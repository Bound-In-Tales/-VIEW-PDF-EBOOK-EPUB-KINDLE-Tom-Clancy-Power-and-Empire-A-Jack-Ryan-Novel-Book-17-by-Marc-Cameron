Tom Clancy Power and Empire (A Jack Ryan Novel Book 17) by Marc Cameron Book Review

Name: L. S. Brodsky
Rating: 1.0 out of 5 stars
Title: If this is the best the franchise can do, it is time to kill the series
Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 9, 2018
Review: This may be the worst author they have used for the Clancy series. He fills up the book with unnecessary descriptions and, especially, explanations of occurrences in past novels. It seems that he is writing this with the goal of catching readers up on everything that has previously happened to each of the characters, which only detracts from following the current plot line. Then after pages and pages of disconnected writing the author realizes he must end the book...and it ends. Mark Greaney is the best they have used and they should move back to him.

Title: Good read - but...
Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2018
Review: I was looking for a distraction, and this came up on my recommendations. I'm a big Tom Clancy/Jack Ryan (Sr.) fan. However, there were times in this book where it felt like acronyms were being thrown around just because some writing formula required a certain number be used. It was a little difficult to keep track of the plot in a few places, and was surprised to look down at one point to see I was 90%+ done with the book and all the story lines were a long way from finished. The ending felt rushed, and frankly, unsatisfying.

All in all, a good book. As I suspect there will be more 'Tom Clancy' novels, will likely have to pay a bit more attention to the actual writer to determine if worth buying at full price, or wait for a sale/borrow from the library.

Title: Very disappointing
Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 17, 2018
Review: Very disappointing. Yes, all the normal characters are in the book. But, who are they? Nothing like the TC characters from previous books. And what about the plot? It's difficult to follow with all the subplots and the book jumps around from subplot1 to subplot2 to the plot, then back to a subplot. The subject matter is very dark (child pornography) and much more graphic violence than expected. This book does not follow the the typical TC genre. I could not finish it.

Title: Predictable, unorganized, and disappointing
Date: Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2018
Review: Long time reader of the TC series.. I'm so disappointed with the quality (or lack thereof) in this book. The book bounces back and forth between unrelated subplots that, while the book tries to establish a link, have nothing to do with each other. Additionally, there are so many mini-plots that only last a few chapters and are built up for a climax that never happens. You just read to the end of the chapter and think "oh, that's it?" Meanwhile, the main character's who've grown and develop over the years have reverted back to their prior lives. Clark breaking all the rules because he's angry about how a girl was treated. Jr falling for a girl involved in the other subplot. I've grown to love these characters and Cameron didn't due the series justice. These books are certainly going downhill since Greaney left...

Title: but this one is so boring and disjointed and does nothing to further the established ...
Date: Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2018
Review: I can't believe I'm leaving such a negative review for the latest book in the Tom Clancy Jack Ryan storyline, but this one is just so painfully written. Usually I devour the latest book in a weekend, as I'm unable to put it down, but this one is so boring and disjointed and does nothing to further the established and beloved characters... It's been over a month and I'm forcing myself to try to read 10-15 pages at a time, just so I can get it over with.

Compared to Mark Greaney's "True Faith and Allegience" this one falls way, way short, I'm sorry to say.

Title: I have read all the Tom Clancy books and this was not a good one
Date: Reviewed in the United States on September 22, 2018
Review: To make this simple and to paraphrase a famous politician... I have read Tom Clancy's best and this is not one of them. Yes, I know that Tom Clancy has passed on. In my opinion, there are too many writers now using his name seemingly to make a quick buck. Unlike say Vince Flynn and choosing 1 writer to continue the Mitch Rapp series, there is at least 1 writer too many using Tom Clancy. Mark Greany does a much better job at emulating Clancy's style. Mark Cameron might be better suited to writing under his own name... only!

While Tom Clancy used to skip around some, there is so much skipping from one part to another in this book that it us somewhat hard to keep track of without stopping and saying... wait, who was this person? More importantly, a lot of the events are simply unnecessary, left unexplained and do nothing for the story. Even the part of the Chinese freighter exploding really has no part in the book or the outcome. Certainly, the whole waste of pages explaining why the coast guard rescue swimmer chose the Coast Guard over the Air Force plays no conceivable part. What difference did it make to the whole story? NONE. The same could be said for many things including explaining about how the new person, Lisanne, who now makes the travel arrangements for the Campus, came to be and her duties several times - as well as making sure to say several times how she offers to do more and wants to. Gee, could that be a hint that in a book or two down the line, she will become the next operations person? Was that really necessary. Jack Ryan Jr. was called Junior too many times, and while always playing him up as the good guy with more morals, suddenly seems to now be the guy who gets the foreign girl in every book whether the Asian girl in this book, or the girl from Iran in a previous book, etc. He is looking like too much of a playboy, and what happened to respecting women. At one point, he is ready to give up his seat on the train in a gentleman like fashion, yet has no problem hanging behind at the end to obviously go to bed with the foreign agent on her "private tour". Sorry, not every guy just wants another notch on the bed post, and if you look at his earlier behaviors, it probably wouldn't happen this time either. He would probably be hearing his mother's voice in his head or his father's and would have just gone home. In today's world, there was far too much disrespect for all of the women in this book. No, this isn't my first Clancy/Cameron book, but for me... It will be the last.
